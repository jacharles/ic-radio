# Invisible City Radio

Basic website for Invisible City which will be deploying in the summer of 2019.

## Client

Uses Angular 7 to persist the livestream regardless of where the user navigates to on the site.

## Server

Will use spring boot to retrieve the latest live video from Livestream's servers and send it back to the client for dynamic video loading. Currently just uses a stubbed static encoding.
